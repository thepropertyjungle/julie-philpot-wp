    Please make sure you have set your search pages
    within your website and created your Global
    Dynamic Options.

    You'll need to add your main search page to
    the forms action="" attribute.

    E.g. {{ $global_options['dynamic_options']['search_list']['permalink'] }}

    If in doubt, please refer to:
