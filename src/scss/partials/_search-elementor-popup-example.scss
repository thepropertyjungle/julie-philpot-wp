        This search form is specific to displaying within an Elementor
        popup. If you plan to use a search form in an Elementor popup
        on your website, this is the one to use. Elementor injects
        popups when required, and does not always render them in the
        HTML. This means it can affect JavaScript behaviour.

        This is a starter search form to get you going, it does not
        include all possible query variables, but it does cover most
        use cases.
